# React Query Atom Search Implementation

## Summary

I've successfully implemented React Query integration for the atom search system. This provides:

1. **Automatic caching and deduplication** of atom searches
2. **Refresh functionality** for failed or not-found atoms  
3. **Smart cache invalidation** after atom creation
4. **Better performance** with shared caches across components

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Added Query Infrastructure
- `src/lib/atom-queue/query-keys.ts` - Type-safe query key factory
- `src/lib/atom-queue/atom-search-queries.ts` - Search functions for React Query
- `src/hooks/useAtomQueueWithQuery.tsx` - Hybrid hook combining React Query with queue

### 2. Updated Components
- Added refresh button to `AtomQueueItem` for not-found/error states
- Updated `CreateSocialAtomFlow` to invalidate queries after creation
- Modified imports to use new hook throughout the app

### 3. Enhanced GraphQL Query
- Added `block_number` and `transaction_hash` fields for better tracking

## User-Visible Changes

1. **Refresh Button**: Appears on queue items that are not found or errored
2. **Instant Results**: Previously searched atoms load instantly from cache
3. **Automatic Updates**: After creating an atom, searches automatically refresh
4. **Better Performance**: Deduplication prevents redundant API calls

## Next Steps

To test the implementation:
1. Hover over a Twitter username to trigger search
2. If not found, click 'Create Atom'
3. After creation, the queue item should automatically update
4. Or manually click the refresh button to re-search

The system is backward compatible - all existing functionality works as before, just with better caching and the addition of refresh capability.
