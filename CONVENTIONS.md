Yes! There are several ways you can organize your code to make it easier for me to understand and help you more effectively:

## 1. **TypeScript Types & Interfaces**
- Define explicit types for all function parameters and return values
- Export shared types from dedicated `types/` directories
- Use descriptive interface names that explain the domain concept
```typescript
// Good: Clear domain modeling
interface UserAuthenticationState {
  isAuthenticated: boolean
  user: User | null
  permissions: Permission[]
}

// vs unclear: any, unknown, or missing types
```

## 2. **File Organization & Naming**
- Use consistent file naming patterns (kebab-case, PascalCase for components)
- Group related functionality together
- Keep files focused on a single responsibility
- Use descriptive names that indicate purpose:
  ```
  auth-provider.tsx (not provider.tsx)
  use-wallet-connection.ts (not use-connection.ts)
  ```

## 3. **Documentation Comments**
- Add JSDoc comments for complex functions explaining:
  - Purpose and business logic
  - Parameter meanings
  - Side effects
  - Example usage
```typescript
/**
 * Validates and submits a trust claim to the Intuition protocol.
 * Handles both on-chain submission and local state updates.
 * 
 * @param claim - The claim data including subject, predicate, and object
 * @param options - Additional options like gas settings
 * @returns Transaction hash if successful
 * @throws {InsufficientFundsError} if wallet balance too low
 */
async function submitTrustClaim(claim: TrustClaim, options?: SubmitOptions) {
```

## 4. **Context Files**
Create documentation files in your project root or key directories:
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` - High-level system design
- `CONCEPTS.md` - Domain-specific terminology
- `API.md` - Key APIs and their purposes
- Component-level README files for complex features

## 5. **Consistent Patterns**
- Use the same patterns for similar operations (data fetching, error handling)
- Standardize hook naming (`use` prefix)
- Consistent error handling approach
- Standard folder structure across features

## 6. **Clear Dependency Flow**
- Avoid circular dependencies
- Make data flow obvious (props down, events up)
- Use dependency injection for testability

## 7. **Domain Glossary**
Since you're working with Intuition protocol, having a glossary would help:
```typescript
// domain-types.ts
/**
 * Trust: A connection between entities in the Intuition protocol
 * Claim: An assertion about a relationship (subject-predicate-object)
 * Vault: Smart contract holding staked assets
 */
```

## 8. **Example Usage**
Include example files or test files that show typical usage:
```typescript
// examples/submit-claim.example.ts
// Shows the complete flow of submitting a claim
```

## 9. **State Management Clarity**
- Document what state lives where and why
- Clear separation between UI state and domain state
- Explicit data flow documentation

## 10. **Error Messages**
Use descriptive error messages that explain what went wrong and potentially how to fix it:
```typescript
throw new Error(`Failed to connect wallet: User rejected connection. Please approve the connection request in your wallet.`)
```

Would you like me to look at specific parts of your codebase and suggest how to apply these patterns? I'm particularly interested in understanding your Intuition protocol integration better.
